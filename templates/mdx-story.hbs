<!-- You don't need to include both story formats (mdx / tsx)
    they are both included for your convenience -->

import { action } from "@storybook/addon-actions";
import { Canvas, Meta, Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";

import {{name}} from "./{{name}}";

<Meta title="MDX/{{name}}" component={ {{name}} } />

# {{name}}

With `MDX` we can define a story for `{{name}}` right in the middle of our
Markdown documentation.

This repo also supports Storybook Controls, which allows
you to manipulate the component props straight from your Storybook Canvas! It auto-generates the controls based on the
**args** passed to the Story. You can
further customize this by passing **argTypes** check the [docs
here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)
for more info!

<!--- This is your MDX story template, works just like TSX! -->

export const ComponentStory = props => <{{name}} {...props} />;

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Enabled"
        args=\{{
            text: "Hello",
            disabled: false,
            onClick: action("Button clicked!"),
        }} 
    >
        {ComponentStory.bind({})}
    </Story>
    <Story
        name="Disabled"
        args=\{{
            text: "World",
            disabled: true,
        }}
    >
        {ComponentStory.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
