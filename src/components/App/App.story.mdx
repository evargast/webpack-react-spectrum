# App

With `MDX` we can define a story for `App` right in the middle of our
Markdown documentation.

This repo also supports Storybook Controls, which allows
you to manipulate the component props straight from your Storybook Canvas! It auto-generates the controls based on the
**args** passed to the Story. You can
further customize this by passing **argTypes** check the [docs
here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)
for more info!

<!--- This is your MDX story template, works just like TSX! -->

export const ComponentStory = props => <App {...props} />;

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Welcome">{ComponentStory.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>
